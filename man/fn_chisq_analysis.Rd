\usage{
fn_chisq_analysis(
  data,
  col_stage_current,
  col_grade,
  passing_grades,
  cols_demographics,
  min_subgroup_n = 5,

\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset with demographic variables,
Grade, and ScorePct columns}

\item{col_stage_current}{Character string specifying the column name for stages}

\item{col_grade}{Character string specifying the column name containing the grade information}

\item{passing_grades}{A vector of values that are considered passing grades}

\item{cols_demographics}{Character vector of demographic column names to analyse}

\item{min_subgroup_n}{Minimum number of students required in each Pass/Fail
category for a subgroup to be included. Default is 5}

\item{verbose_stats}{Logical indicating whether to include detailed chi-square
statistics or just p-values and Cramér's V. Default is FALSE}

\item{include_ci}{Logical indicating whether to include confidence intervals
for pass rates. Default is TRUE}

\item{overall_test}{Logical indicating whether to perform overall chi-square
test for each demographic. Default is TRUE}

\item{use_binary_fallback}{Logical indicating whether to use binary comparison
(most common vs others) when original analysis fails due to small groups.
Default is TRUE}

\item{binary_on_any_exclusion}{Logical indicating whether to use binary fallback
if ANY subgroup needs to be excluded (not just when analysis completely fails).
Default is FALSE}

\item{entry_override}{Character string specifying a demographic name that should
use "Foundation" vs "Not Foundation" comparison instead of other approaches.
Default is NULL}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{results_tables}{List of tibbles, one per demographic, with subgroup
    statistics including count, observed mean score, pass rate (as percentage),
    and confidence intervals}
  \item{exclusion_summary}{Tibble summarising exclusions per demographic}
  \item{overall_tests}{Tibble with overall chi-square test results per demographic,
    including Cramér's V effect size (ranges from 0 to 1, where 0.1 = small effect,
    0.3 = medium effect, 0.5 = large effect)}
}
}
\description{
This function performs chi-square tests for each demographic factor against
pass/fail rates derived from Grade data. It handles minimum group size requirements
and can fallback to binary comparisons when needed. Includes Cramér's V effect size
to assess the strength of associations.
