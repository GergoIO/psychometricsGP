\usage{
fn_anova_analysis(data, col_stage, col_score, cols_demographics, cols_anova)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset.}

\item{col_stage}{A string specifying the column name for the stages (e.g., "Stage").}

\item{col_score}{A string specifying the column name for the score variable (e.g., "Score").}

\item{cols_demographics}{A character vector of column names for the demographic variables (e.g., c("Gender", "AgeGroup")).}

\item{cols_anova}{A character vector of column names to test in the ANOVA (e.g., c("Gender", "AgeGroup", "Region")).}
}
\value{
A data frame with ANOVA results. The columns include:
\describe{
  \item{Factor}{The demographic factor being tested.}
  \item{Stage}{The stage corresponding to the subset of the data.}
  \item{Method}{The method used for the analysis (e.g., "Individual", "All", "All - Drop1").}
  \item{data}{Degrees of freedom for the factor.}
  \item{sumsq}{Sum of squares for the factor.}
  \item{rss}{Residual sum of squares (meansq for the factor).}
  \item{AIC}{Akaike Information Criterion for the model.}
  \item{F.statistic}{F-statistic value for the ANOVA.}
  \item{p.value}{P-value for the factor in the ANOVA.}
}
}
\description{
This function performs individual and combined ANOVA analyses for each demographic factor,
as well as a drop1 test for factor removal. The individual ANOVA is performed for each
demographic factor, and a combined ANOVA is run for all factors. Additionally, a drop1
test is applied to assess the effect of each factor when removed.
