\title{Scores by Demographics with Adjusted Means}
\usage{
fn_scores_by_demographics(data, col_stage, col_score, cols_demographics)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset.}

\item{col_stage}{A string specifying the column name for the stages (e.g., "Stage").}

\item{col_score}{A string specifying the column name for the score variable (e.g., "Score").}

\item{cols_demographics}{A character vector of column names for the demographic variables (e.g., c("Gender", "AgeGroup")).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{StageCurrent}{The stage corresponding to the subset of the data.}
  \item{Factor}{The demographic variable being analyzed.}
  \item{Level}{The specific level within the demographic factor (e.g., "Male", "Female").}
  \item{Count}{The number of observations in each level of the factor.}
  \item{ObservedMean}{The observed mean score for each level of the demographic factor.}
  \item{AdjustedMean}{The adjusted mean score, accounting for other factors in the model.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the observed mean scores and adjusted mean scores
for each level of demographic factors, within each stage of a given dataset.
The observed mean is simply the average score for each group, while the
adjusted mean is calculated by fitting a linear model to account for the
influence of other factors.

# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  Stage = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "A", "B"),
  Score = c(85, 90, 88, 93, 87, 95),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male"),
  AgeGroup = c("Young", "Old", "Young", "Old", "Young", "Old")
)

# Example usage
results <- fn_scores_by_demographics(data, col_stage = "Stage", col_score = "Score", cols_demographics = c("Gender", "AgeGroup"))
print(results)
