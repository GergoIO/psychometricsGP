\title{Add Plot to Officer Report with Automatic Sequential Numbering}
\usage{
fn_report_add_plot(
  report = NULL,
  plot = NULL,
  plot_count = NULL,
  caption = NULL,
  stop_trailing_line = FALSE,
  dimensions = c(15.24, 10.16)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{report}{officer report object to be modified.}

\item{plot}{ggplot2 plot object to be embedded in the report.}

\item{plot_count}{Integer; the sequential figure number. This should be an integer variable in the calling scope and will be incremented automatically.}

\item{caption}{Character string; description placed beneath the plot.}

\item{stop_trailing_line}{Logical; if FALSE or NULL, adds a blank line for spacing after the plot and caption. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{dimensions}{Numeric vector of length two specifying plot width and height in centimetres. Defaults to c(15.24, 10.16).}
}
\value{
Officer report object with plot and caption appended.
}
\description{
Adds a ggplot2 plot and caption to an officer report object.
Automatically increments the specified plot count variable in the caller's workspace,
so subsequent plots are sequentially numbered. Intended for building professional
assessment and performance reports.
}
\details{
This function adds a ggplot2 graphic and caption to an officer report,
with automatic figure numbering using a local plot count variable.
It is designed to be run with a mutable integer variable, typically called \code{n_plot} or \code{plot_count},
in the caller's environment, which will be incremented as plots are added.
}
\section{Usage Example}{


\dontrun{
library(officer)
library(ggplot2)

my_report <- read_docx()
n_plot <- 1

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg)) + geom_histogram()

my_report <- fn_report_add_plot(
  report = my_report,
  plot = p,
  plot_count = n_plot,
  caption = "Distribution of Miles Per Gallon in mtcars dataset."
)
# n_plot is automatically incremented after each call

# Add another plot (shows figure number increasing)
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp)) + geom_histogram()
my_report <- fn_report_add_plot(
  report = my_report,
  plot = p2,
  plot_count = n_plot,
  caption = "Distribution of Horsepower."
)
}
