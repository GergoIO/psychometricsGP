\title{Create Empty Lists From a Vector of Strings}
\usage{
fnListsFromVector(assessmentType = NULL, listsToCreate)
}
\arguments{
\item{assessmentType}{(OPTIONAL) A string - the current assessment being analysed (either "ADK" or "ADTK"). Setting this overrides any set}

\item{listsToCreate}{(OPTIONAL) A vector of strings.}
}
\value{
Creates the required empty lists based on the assessment type in the main (global) environment
}
\description{
This function uses an input of the assessment type ('assessmentType') being analysed. Then, the empty lists to create are set (as a vector) based on the assessment type. Each element of the vector is checked. If the element does not already exist as a variable, then a new variable (an empty list, with the name of the vector element) is created. Alternatively, if the required 'assessmentType' is not configured, set a variable 'listsToCreate' as the vector of strings to create lists from. One of 'assessmentType' or 'listsToCreate' must be defined. Setting 'listsToCreate' overrides a defined 'assessmentType'. If 'assessmentType' is not defined and 'listsToCreate' is defined, the function will create empty lists with the name of the items stored in the 'listsToCreate' vector of strings.
}
\examples{
# If using a preconfigured assessmentType:
fnListsFromVector(assessmentType = "ADK")
#if manually setting the list of strings to create empty lists from:
fnListsFromVector(listsToCreate = c("list1", "list2"))
