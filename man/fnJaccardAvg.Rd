\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with at least the columns StudentID and ItemID.}
}
\value{

\examples{
# Create a data frame with overlapping items
df <- data.frame(
  StudentID = rep(c("Student1", "Student2", "Student3", "Student4"), each = 10),
  ItemID = c(1:10, 5:14, 10:19, 15:24)
)

# Calculate the average Jaccard index
avg_jaccard <- fnJaccardAvg(df)

# Print the average Jaccard index
print(avg_jaccard)
